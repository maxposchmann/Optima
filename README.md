# Optima

Optima is a software library designed to solve inverse problems, which are reduced to non-linear least squares problems.

Optima uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, with the Jacobian approximated by applying rank-one updates using Broyden's method.

This approach has proven to be particularly useful at solving inverse problems of very complex physical models that cannot be optimized 
directly in a practical way.
